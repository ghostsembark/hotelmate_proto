# HotelMate

> A B2B SaaS platform enabling seamless collaboration between Hotels and Tour Operators / DMCs.

---

## Overview

HotelMate is a **B2B SaaS platform** that enables Hotels and Tour Operators / DMCs to collaborate seamlessly through a single, contract-driven system. It digitizes the entire hotel–operator lifecycle — from rate negotiation and contract signing to live availability, booking, and payments.

---

## Problem Statement

Hotel–operator collaboration today is **fragmented and manual**:

| Challenge | Current State |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Pricing Negotiations** | Happen over email or WhatsApp |
| **Contracts** | Shared as static PDFs |
| **Availability Checks** | Performed offline |
| **Booking Confirmations** | Require repeated follow-ups |

### Impact

This fragmented approach results in:

- ⏱️ **Delays** in response and confirmation times
- ❌ **Errors** in pricing and booking details
- 📅 **Overbookings** due to outdated availability data
- ⚖️ **Disputes** arising from unclear terms and miscommunication

---

## Solution

HotelMate provides a **unified platform** where hotels and operators can:

- 🔐 **Securely contract** — Digitize and sign agreements in one place
- 📊 **Share live prices and availability** — Real-time inventory and rate management
- 💼 **Transact bookings with clarity and trust** — Transparent booking workflow

### Key Benefit

> All commercial terms are defined once and enforced automatically across bookings.
